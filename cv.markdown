## Projects Undertaken

### 1) Cell Phone Based Distant Object Control

#### Platform: Circuit Board

In this project a [remote-controlled car](/assets/img/13032009263.jpg) was built that can be controlled
using [DTMF tones](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual-tone_multi-frequency_signaling)
of a cellphone. Since cell phone reception has a global coverage, the RC car can be controlled from any where
in the world.

This was built for a project competition and has won **first prize** in the National Symposium "COMPSEM-09"
organized by Annamalai University in year 2009.

### 2) Visual Speech Synthesis

#### Platform: Visual C++

In this project, a software was implemented to convert an
input text into an audiovisual speech stream and play it **incorporating the
head and eye movements** of a human being in real-time. Instead of relying on
existing speech engines (like Festival), a new engine is created which
**resolves ambiguities** in English language properly and has an **Indian
accent**.

### 3) IPwatch

#### Platform: C

[IPwatch](https://github.com/samueljohnson/IPwatch/blob/master/ipwatch.c) maintains a database (sqlite3) of IP address that are assigned to MAC addresses and informs sysadmins (and optionally users) of any misuse of IP in a network.

### 4) Steganography Removal

#### Platform: C

The project deals with creation of a tool which removes steganographic content
from a file. The idea is to implement the tool in corporate environment's mail server,
where every outgoing e-mail is first sent to this tool.
